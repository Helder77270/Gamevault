// Chain + deployed contract addresses — THE single place to update.
// Decided 2026-07-23: Base Sepolia (simpler tooling than World Chain for
// now; The Graph works there; World ID via IDKit cloud verification).
// Empty address = not deployed yet; consumers degrade gracefully (ticketd
// skips ownerOf with a loud warning, launcher falls back to offline mode).
// Self-contained module (subpath export: @gamevault/shared/deployments).
